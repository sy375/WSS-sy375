Project Title: Nonlinear Feedback Shift Register (NFSR)

Project Description: Linear Feedback Shift Registers(LFSR) have long been used to produce random sequences/numbers for various devices as USB, Wi-Fi, 3G networks, and etc. However, there has not been close studies on the feedback shift registers with nonlinear functions. My goal of the project is to find the configurations of taps and nonlinear functions that produce random sequences of Feedback Shift Register (i.e. sequences that pass frequency test).
